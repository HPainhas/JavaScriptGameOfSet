		<p class="margin"><strong>"Set" is a card game in which players attempt to find a group of cards that satisfy a particular criterion. It is a speed game: 12 cards are dealt face-up, and the players try to be the first to make a set from the visible cards. For a complete description of the game see the Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)">entry</a>.</strong></p>
